# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

## Description

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. It is a mock page for a coffee shop found within the Triple Peaks Library. The page can be used to view the menu options, has a form for booking a table, a section for recipes, and a small "About the coffee shop" section. The page also features navigation links at the top of the page and social media links in the footer.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The biggest improvement I would like to make on the project is to make the "Book a Table" form actually submittable. Having the form serve a purpose and not just be cosmetic is the goal.
